           <p class="section-discretion">The book The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture cited Ash as an example of cultural identification, with the character going through similar motions players of the games had to in order to progress through them.[42] It additionally emphasized the character's growth and development as the anime series progressed.[43] UGO.com noted his hat as iconic and one of the coolest headgear in gaming, while Jian DeLeon of Complex praised him as "stylish," particularly his very first design.[44][45] The Guinness Book of World Records 2011 Game Edition lists Ash as coming 37th out of 50 in a readers' poll of their favorite video game characters.[46] However, he has been criticized by IGN for staying the same age, his lack of success, and the ambiguity about his father.[47]

            Ash has also garnered praise for serving as a role-model to children, and for his persistence despite being an underdog by Business Insider Australia.[48] He has also been cited as a character that incentivizes trying to be the best person you can be, rather than the strongest, or most qualified by the BBC.[49]
            
            Ash's Manalo Conference win has been compared to basketball player LeBron James winning his first ring and film director Martin Scorsese winning his first Oscar.[50]</p>
